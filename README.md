# Project Plan
## Idea description / Requirements.
In an effort to push for ways to build healthy habits, our idea is to build a mobile application for users of Android devices to enable them to take control of their water intake.

To do so, our application should be able to: 
- set up:

    > User would enter their weight and based on that information the app would then calculate the average amount of water that they need to drink.

- record:

    > User would keep track of their daily intake

- remember:

   > User would be reminded with push notifications or otherwise to drink water at specific times.
    
- learn about healthy habits:

    > User would learn more about water intake and other healthy habits through the use of fun facts displayed prominently in the app.
    
## Schedule, breakdown of the timeline.

Team plans on holding weekly sprint meetings to check in on progress of the progress. First meeting will be held on Tuesday, April 10, 2018.

## Division of work and assignment to each team member.

All features are split equally between team members with each one assigned with one particular feature.

- Ha Eun Jo: set up
- Tenzin Choeying: record
- Alex Keating (Team Lead): remember
- Aury Bwashi: learn about healthy habits.
